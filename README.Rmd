`rdpla`: R client for Digital Public Library of America

[Digital Public Library of America][dpla] brings together metadata from libraries, archives,
and museums in the US, and makes it freely available via their web portal as well as 
an API. DPLA's portal and API don't provide the items themselves from contributing 
institutions, but they provide links to make it easy to find things. The kinds of 
things DPLA holds metadata for include images of works held in museums, photographs
from various photographic collections, texts, sounds, and moving images. 

DPLA has [a great API](https://github.com/dpla/platform) with good documentation - 
a rare thing in this world. Further documentation on their API can be found on their [search fields](https://dp.la/info/developers/codex/responses/field-reference/) and [examples of queries](https://dp.la/info/developers/codex/requests/).  Metadata schema information [here](https://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DPLA-MAP-V3.1-2.pdf).

DPLA data data can be used for a variety of use cases in various academic and 
non-academic fields. Here are some examples (vignettes to come soon showing examples): 

* Search for all photos of churches and make vizualization of 
their metadata through time
* Visualize data from individual collections - a maintainer of a collection
could gain insight from via DPLA data
* Search for all works within a spatial area, map results

DPLA API has two main services (quoting from [their API docs](https://dp.la/info/developers/codex/requests/)):

* items: A reference to the digital representation of a single piece of content indexed by 
the DPLA. The piece of content can be, for example, a book, a photograph, a video, etc. The 
content is digitized from its original, physical source and uploaded to an online repository. 
* collections: A collection is a little more abstract than an item. Where an item is a 
reference to the digital representation of a physical object, a collection is a 
representation of the grouping of a set of items.

Note that you can only run examples/vignette/tests if you have an API key. See 
`?dpla_get_key` to get an API key.

## Installation

Stable version from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rdpla")
```

Dev version from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rdpla")
```

```{r}
library('rdpla')
```

## Authentication

You need an API key to use the DPLA API. Use `dpla_get_key()` to request a key, which will then be emailed to you. Pass in the key in the `key` parameter in functions in this package or you can store the key in your `.Renviron` as `DPLA_API_KEY` or in your `.Rprofile` file under the name `dpla_api_key`.

## Search - items

> Note: limiting fields returned for readme brevity.

Basic search

```{r}
dpla_items(q="fruit", page_size=5, fields=c("provider","creator"))
```

Limit fields returned

```{r}
dpla_items(q="fruit", page_size = 10, fields=c("publisher","format"))
```

Limit records returned

```{r}
dpla_items(q="fruit", page_size=2, fields=c("provider","title"))
```

Search by date

```{r}
dpla_items(q="science", date_before=1900, page_size=10, fields=c("id","date"))
```

Search on specific fields

```{r}
dpla_items(description="obituaries", page_size=2, fields="description")
```

```{r}
dpla_items(subject="yodeling", page_size=2, fields="subject")
```

```{r}
dpla_items(provider="HathiTrust", page_size=2, fields="provider")
```

Spatial search, across all spatial fields

```{r}
dpla_items(sp='Boston', page_size=2, fields=c("id","provider"))
```

Spatial search, by states

```{r}
dpla_items(sp_state='Massachusetts OR Hawaii', page_size=2, fields=c("id","provider"))
```

Faceted search

```{r}
dpla_items(facets=c("sourceResource.spatial.state","sourceResource.spatial.country"),
      page_size=0, facet_size=5)
```

## Search - collections

Search for collections with the words _university of texas_

```{r}
dpla_collections(q="university of texas", page_size=2)
```

You can also search in the `title` and `description` fields

```{r}
dpla_collections(description="east")
```

## Visualize

Visualize metadata from the DPLA - histogram of number of records per state (includes __states__ outside the US)

```{r tidy=FALSE}
out <- dpla_items(facets="sourceResource.spatial.state", page_size=0, facet_size=25)
library("ggplot2")
library("scales")
ggplot(out$facets$sourceResource.spatial.state$data, aes(reorder(term, count), count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_grey(base_size = 16) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(x="State", y="Records")
```
